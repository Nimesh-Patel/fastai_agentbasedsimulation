FastSTI provides for a wide variety of models without any code being modified by
the user. But some modellers are likely to encounter limitations. For example,
they may want to model TB coinfection with HIV, or implement a cure event, or
more sophisticated agent generation, or provide additional statistics.

To do this, you need to program in C. This guide assumes knowledge of C
programming as well as the source code control system Git.
