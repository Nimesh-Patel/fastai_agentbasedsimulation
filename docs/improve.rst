Help improve |PROJECT|
######################

We appreciate help with |PROJECT|, both with coding and documentation. Here are
some things that need to be done:

- Built-in calibration: At present if you want to calibrate a |PROJECT| model,
  you'd best use R or Python to process agent output files from |PROJECT|, and generate .ini
  configuration files as input back into |PROJECT| with new parameters. We think
  it would probably be better if |PROJECT|'s configuration could be enhanced to
  calibrate the model.

- Concurrent relationships: Although the fsti_agent data structure supports
  concurrent relationships, none of the events are currently designed to handle
  meaningfully concurrent relationships.

- More events: Code variations on the current events and new events.

- Build Python and R interfaces to |PROJECT|.

- Improve this documentation.

Feel free to clone the Github repository and submit patches. But before doing
so, it may be best to email nathangeffen@gmail.com to inform us what you
would like to do, so we can discuss the best way to proceed.
