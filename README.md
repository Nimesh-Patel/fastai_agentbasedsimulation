# FastSTI: Agent-based simulator of sexually transmitted infections

FastSTI is a microsimulation framework for modelling sexually transmitted
infections (STIs).

It is written in C and designed to be fast and efficient. It is capable of
running simulations of tens of millions of agents on modern consumer hardware.

The code is available under the GPL-3 license.

The [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://faststi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
explains how to install and use FastSTI.

There's a web interface to a toy version of FastSTI on `Simhub
<https://www.simhub.online/faststi/>`_ that you can play around with to get a
feel for how it works.
